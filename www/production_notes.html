  <h2 align="center"> BLINDSIGHT PRODUCTION INFORMATION</h2>
  <p align="center"> &rdquo;Just because you lose your sight,  
    doesn’t mean you lose your vision.&ldquo;<br />
    - Blind climber Erik Weihenmayer</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p align="center"> Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Himalayas, BLINDSIGHT follows the 
    gripping adventure of six Tibetan teenagers who set out to climb the 23,000-foot Lhakpa 
    Ri on the north side of Mount Everest. The dangerous journey soon becomes a 
    seemingly impossible challenge -- made all the more remarkable by the fact that the 
    teenagers are blind.<br />
    <br />
    Believed by many Tibetans to be possessed by demons, the children are shunned by 
    their parents, scorned by their villages and rejected by society. Rescued by Sabriye 
    Tenberken, a blind educator and adventurer who established the first and only school 
    for the blind in Tibet, the students invite the famous blind mountain climber Erik 
    Weihenmayer to visit their school after learning about his conquest of Everest. Erik 
    arrives in Lhasa and inspires Sabriye and her students Kyila, Sonam Bhumtso, Tashi, 
    Gyenshen, Dachung and Tenzin to let him lead them higher than they have ever been 
    before. The resulting 3-week journey is beyond anything any of them could have 
    predicted.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">THE MAKING OF BLINDSIGHT</h2>
  <p align="center"> The idea for the expedition came about after blind educator Sabriye Tenberken, who 
    founded the school Braille Without Borders for the blind in Lhasa, wrote the following 
    email letter to the world renowned blind mountaineer Erik Weihenmayer, upon hearing 
    the news that he had summitted Mt. Everest in 2001.  Sabriye had read Erik’s book 
    TOUCH THE TOP OF THE WORLD to the students in the school, and was inspired to 
    get in touch following the incredible news of his summit. <br />
    <br />
    The following is the letter that sparked the whole expedition and then film.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">EMAILED FROM LHASA, TIBET, 2001:</h2>
  <p align="center"> Dear Erik, <br />
    After you reached the top of the world our Tibetan neighbour rushed into our centre 
    and told the kids about your success. Some of them didn’t believe it at first but then 
    there was a mutual understanding; if you could climb to the top of the world, we also 
    can overcome our borders and show to the world that the blind can equally participate 
    in society and are able to accomplish great things. <br />
    <br />
    Since my boyfriend Paul and I had read your book with great pleasure, I decided to tell 
    the children about your life. Just one week ago I told the children in our centre all 
    about your childhood, how you became blind, how you dropped your canes from 
    bridges, how you finally met other blind people and then how you became confident in 
    wrestling. All of them were very impressed by all these experiences you had and they 
    compared your experiences with their own ones. Again they realized that it does not 
    matter much if you are a blind child in Germany, USA or Tibet, the experience one has 
    who becomes blind, the embarrassment at first, the confidence which builds up slowly 
    but steadily, the reaction of the sighted is probably for every blind person the same.  
    After I had told your story to the children, the boys were walking together with some of 
    our sighted colleagues through the inner part of Lhasa. Lhasa is not the blind- 
    friendliest city in the world. There are lots of holes in the street, which sometimes are a 
    few meters deep. Construction sites are never protected through wires. It can happen 
    that you step in huge puddles of dirty water or even excrements. Most of our children 
    know their way through this chaos. I teach them mobility and they are quite confident 
    in using their canes. They always think that if I could find my way around they also 
    have to try. The only problem is that they are sometimes very embarrassed to show 
    their canes since nomads and pilgrims who never saw a cane before often make fun 
    about them. They call them “blind fools”, imitate them and laugh about them. One of 
    the boys however once turned around and said: “you can not talk to me like that, I am 
    blind but I am not a fool! And did you ever go to school, do you know how to read and 
    write? Can you find the toilet in the middle of the night without a torch?”  
    Not all of these children have this pride and confidence to react in such a strong way. I 
    often tell them, that they should understand that these people are just stupid. And if 
    they can, they should say something back. Most of them now like the idea to defend 
    themselves in a verbal way. First, they try to reply in a rather friendly way and if this 
    does not help, they are starting to shout back, make fun of them and soon they have 
    the crowd on their side. <br />
    <br />
    And still, if a sighted friend is around, they try to hide away their canes to walk invisible 
    and convenient on the arm of the sighted.<br />
    <br />
    And at this day when I ended your story by saying, ‘this man, who is blind like you 
    climbed the top of the world, not by holding the arm of a sighted friend, but with the 
    help of some strings and two canes,’ they all proudly decided to walk on their own 
    without the convenience of walking with the sighted. Stories like yours changed their 
    lives. Most of them now understand that there is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
    They can be very proud little people, and they say quite often: “we are blind, so what? 
    We can speak English and Chinese, we can find our way in the labyrinth of Lhasa’s 
    walkways, we are able to read and write in three different Braille scripts and we read 
    and write without using light.” <br />
    <br />
    Last week I told them already that I wanted to write to you to ask if you would like to 
    come to Tibet, maybe even to do a small climbing workshop with our kids. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Two years ago, some of our students started with rock climbing, taught by Tibetan 
    Everest guides from the Tibetan mountain climbing institute. After you have reached 
    the Everest I talked to this climbing teacher about the idea of inviting you to Lhasa. He 
    became very interested and since then we were searching for your e-mail address.  
    In a way, we are something like colleagues, maybe in encouraging the blind to stand 
    up, to find and to overcome their own borders. <br />
    <br />
    As I read from your book we have the same philosophy, similar history and a similar 
    way of approaching ideas. <br />
    <br />
    We all would be very excited if you could visit our project. Paul and I also want to 
    come to the States in the beginning of the next year and maybe we have the chance 
    to meet you somewhere there first. <br />
    <br />
    Right now I am sitting in our computer room. Next to me is Gyenshen, a brilliant young 
    student who became blind with the age of 9. He together with two other girls get 
    computer lessons and he also is writing a letter to you. <br />
    <br />
    Gyenshen comes from a very remote and poor farmer area. After he became blind his 
    family kept him away in a dark room for three years. The family was embarrassed 
    having a blind child. In Tibet, people believe that blindness is a punishment for 
    something which the person has done bad or wrong, in his/her previous life. People 
    also believe that blind people are possessed by demons. <br />
    <br />
    When he came to our project he was very shy. Now he is one of the best students and 
    is quite confident with handling the computer. He is probably the only one of his village 
    who knows that the world is round, and that one can communicate through just a wire. 
    He is able to tell the other children of the village that “iron yaks” are Toyota 
    Landcruisers which drink gasoline instead of water. <br />
    <br />
    The blind that grow up in Tibet have certainly a totally different life than we in 
    Germany or you in the US. But they feel a close solidarity with blind people from other 
    countries. This connection and solidarity gives them a lot of strength and power to 
    manage their lives. <br />
    <br />
    Today is the international day of the white cane and you help us to fill this day with 
    pride. <br />
    <br />
    Greetings from a sunny and cold Lhasa, greetings from all the children, the staff and 
    especially from Paul. <br />
    <br />
    Say hello to your family. <br />
    <br />
    With lots of good wishes, yours truly, <br />
    <br />
    Sabriye Tenberken </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON THE GENESIS OF THE FILM:</h2>
  <p align="center"> The idea for the film came from Erik Weihenmayer the blind mountaineer and one of 
    the main characters in the film.  Erik was put in contact with film producer Sybil 
    Robson Orr by producer Steven Haft. He thought this story would likely resonate with 
    her because of her interest in Tibet and mountain climbing.  (She met her husband 
    Matthew climbing Kilimanjaro, the same mountain on which Erik got married.)  It only 
    took one meeting with Erik before she decided to make the film. <br />
    <br />
    “Erik told me climbing mountains gave him confidence as a blind teenager and he 
    wanted to share that experience with these blind Tibetan kids.  He asked me if I 
    thought taking 6 blind Tibetan teenagers up a 23,000-foot mountain in the Himalayas 
    sounded like a movie.  I told him it did and decided to make it,” says producer Robson- 
    Orr.  Sybil and Steven Haft had liked Lucy Walker’s ‘Devil’s Playground,’ the critically 
    acclaimed documentary feature about Amish teenagers, and asked her if she’d be 
    interested in directing this project.  Lucy connected with the material personally, and 
    thus the filmmaking unit was complete. </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON BLINDNESS:</h2>
  <p align="center"> “Blind people in Tibet are really lacking in resources, support, understanding, medical 
    care, and expectations, and even at the blind school it was hard to believe that Erik 
    could have done something so immensely challenging” says Lucy Walker, director.  
    “Sabriye herself knew that blind people can do anything they put their minds to, and 
    Erik provided the perfect example for her to instil this in her students - once she had 
    convinced them that it was true. Then they were so overjoyed that Sabriye wrote to 
    Erik to tell him about it. When Erik received the letter he said he &quot;felt like a coward&quot; in 
    comparison to what Sabriye had achieved, and resolved to visit - and then the idea for 
    a climbing expedition was born, as we see in the film”.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON INTERPRETING BLINDNESS CINEMATICALLY:</h2>
  <p align="center"> “I was always anxious not to use the cliché of a soft-focus lens to depict the vision of 
    the blind people in the film who have some vision - because that is not what their 
    vision looks like,” says director Lucy Walker.  “They have all kinds of variations on 
    image distortion, with dancing eyes, or being able to sense light only, all very specific, 
    and I felt we should either go for it or not, but I didn’t want to use an inaccurate 
    analogy like out-of-focus”. </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON THE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE AND LOCATIONS: </h2>
  <p align="center"> The production was divided into 2 shoots; the spring training in May 2004 involved a 
    climb up a vertical rock face and a trek over a 16,000-foot pass beginning at Tsurpu 
    Monastery.  The second shoot from September to November 2004 involved traveling 
    across the Tibetan plateau to all of the 6 kids’ villages, including a trip 1000 km away 
    to southern China, by plane, and an additional 3 days by van to find Tashi’s family in 
    Szechuan Province.  The expedition up the 23,000-foot Lhakpa Ri was also shot in the 
    fall.</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON THE CHALLENGES OF SHOOTING IN TIBET:</h2>
  <p align="center"> Producer Robson-Orr notes, “Shooting in Tibet presents a myriad of challenges.  The 
    most significant being that the Chinese authorities are extremely particular about what 
    you shoot.  If it is not listed on your shot list, approved in Beijing prior to your arrival, 
    they won’t let you shoot it.  You are assigned minders to make sure you don’t.  At the 
    same time, if you are shooting what you said you intended to, there is no problem.  
    Fortunately, we only had the best of intentions and only a few hiccups.” <br />
    <br />
    “When we were shooting in southern China, Szechuan police arrived and demanded 
    we stop shooting at the very moment Tashi was being reunited with his father for the 
    first time in 9 years.  Tashi’s reunion was a major moment in our film, unfolding before 
    our eyes, and it could never be recaptured. Fortunately, Petr Cikhart is very 
    experienced in tense shooting conditions and was not fazed by the pressure.  
    Ultimately, we did get shut down but not before we shot the first 10 golden minutes of 
    the reunion.  The police put us under a ‘house arrest’ of sorts back in our hotel in 
    Luding.  They seemed to be concerned we were shooting something political.  Turns 
    out the film permit we purchased from Beijing only applied to locations listed for Tibet, 
    but not the ones in China.  Fortunately, a senior official from the Tibet Autonomous 
    Region called officials in Luding and told them everything was okay and they let us 
    continue shooting the next day.” </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON CAMERAS AND FOOTAGE: </h2>
  <p align="center"> Producer Robson-Orr says one of the most difficult hurdles of this shoot was getting 
    approval from the Chinese government to bring into Tibet what they refer to as ‘big 
    cameras.’ In the case of BLINDSIGHT, that meant the difference between the 
    Panasonic AG-DVX 100, which is mini-DV, versus the Panasonic AJ-HD27 Vericam, 
    which is high definition.  There was such a short amount of time to prepare for the May 
    training climb, given the restrictions, we were only allowed to bring in what are 
    considered by the Chinese authorities to be ‘tourist’ cameras.  “We determined the 
    best mini-DV video camera with a ‘film’ effect available was the DVX 100. We shot in 
    ‘progressive’ mode with great success. When we returned in the fall, we were 
    equipped with permits for 2 Panasonic high definition cameras, both HD27 Vericam’s 
    and the footage was spectacular, very filmy, really beautiful.  We experimented with 
    ‘video’ and ‘film’ mode on those cameras discovering ‘film’ mode was far superior for 
    not blowing out in tricky light situations and creating beautiful blacks. <br />
    <br />
    After checking the color on the 35mm film out, the timer at St. Anne’s Post in London 
    insisted that a UK Panasonic representative come by to look at BLINDSIGHT that 
    quite seamlessly cuts between DVX100 and the HD27.  He thought the film was a 
    better example of the performance of those two cameras side by side than their own 
    Panasonic show reel. <br />
    <br />
    In total, the filmmakers shot about 250 hours worth of footage and obtained another 
    20 hours worth of archival footage.  In short, they condensed around 270 hours worth 
    of footage into 104 minutes. </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON SHOOTING AT ALTITUDE: </h2>
  <p align="center"> The biggest challenge at altitude is making sure the crew gets enough rest, proper 
    food and most importantly, doesn’t get sick.  In order to shoot the climbing team 
    passing by, the crew had to run ahead of the climbers, set up, let them pass and then 
    run up in front of them again, all the time carrying over 40 pounds of gear and all at 
    altitudes ranging between 15,000 and 22,000 feet. <br />
    <br />
    Concentration is hugely important and is one of the first things to slip when at altitude.  
    Nightly production meetings were held to insure the team was getting the coverage 
    necessary, recognizing there would never be a way to shoot everything, but always 
    checking to make sure what they did have was quality. </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON FILM CREW HEALTH ISSUES: </h2>
  <p align="center"> The film crew did suffer various bouts of illness in the course of the shoot including 
    food poisoning, altitude sickness, flu, amoebic dysentery and giardia.  Sybil Robson- 
    Orr recalls that the director of photography Petr Cikhart was shooting an interview with 
    Kyila “when he politely excused himself from the building, went outside, threw up, 
    came back to his camera and resumed shooting and never mentioned he had been 
    sick.” </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">ON THE IMPACT THE FILMMAKERS HOPE THE FILM WILL HAVE : </h2>
  <p align="center"> Lucy Walker, Director: <br />
    <br />
    “ I hope that this film will be important and enjoyable for blind audiences. I hope that 
    as many blind people as possible will be able to experience the film, and I am 
    delighted that we have a state-of-the-art audio description track for blind audiences, 
    and I hope that this may also encourage more cinemas to install the system. <br />
    <br />
    I feel very privileged to have been able to have spent three months traveling in Tibet, 
    and to have had this chance to get to know some of this unique place and its inspiring 
    inhabitants and beautiful culture, and I am honoured to share that with audiences. In 
    particular, the visits to the six students’ homes and villages are pretty unique, as far as 
    I know, in terms of the access we gained to ordinary Tibetan homes and villages -- 
    and attitudes.  My goal is that people come out of the movie theatre and stay up 
    talking all night about the rights and wrongs, and the pros and cons, and the East and 
    West, and the blind and sighted, and the Tibet and China, and the Sabriye and Erik, 
    and the falling on your face versus falling on your ass of it all…” <br />
    <br />
    Sybil Robson-Orr, Producer: <br />
    <br />
    “My hope is that Sabriye, Erik and the kids inspire our audience to push through their 
    personal boundaries and reach for their dreams.  Through them, we can see that 
    anything in life, whether we are physically challenged or not, is possible if we build the 
    right team around us.  They don’t want to be seen as blind people who do great 
    things, but rather ambassadors for everyone who believes in climbing higher.” <br />
    <br />
    Steven Haft, Executive Producer: <br />
    <br />
    ” In a number of the films I’ve done, it really comes back to what touched me about the 
    story from the start, this film for me asks the question, ‘what does it take for you to get 
    off the sideline in life and engage yourself?’ I believe this is what Sabriye and Erik did, 
    like when Sabriye started the school and Erik was so intrigued by the letter he had 
    from the kids that he went to meet them to try and work with them.  Every audience 
    can relate to this film, in that they can question their own lives, and ask ‘what am I 
    doing to step off the sideline?’ “</p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h2 align="center">BACKGROUND ABOUT THE TITLE “BLINDSIGHT” </h2>
  <p align="center"> The title of the film came about because it was agreed that it was vital not to shy away 
    from the word ‘blind,’ and also that the title needed a unique and unusual feel, to truly 
    reflect the film.  Says Sybil Robson-Orr, producer “The word was initially inspired by 
    how blind people are literally blindsided by society in Tibet.  Blindsided became 
    ‘blindsighted,’ abbreviated to BLINDSIGHT which we thought was a new word.   After 
    conducting an initial title search, we discovered that blindsight is an actual medical 
    phenomenon involving a cortex of the brain in which blind people have a sense of 
    perceived vision.” <br />
    <br />
    ‘Blindsight’ definition : <br />
    <br />
    Visual processing in the brain goes through a series of processing stages. 
    Destruction of the first visual cortical area, primary visual cortex (or V1 or striate 
    cortex) leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the 
    damaged cortical representation. The area of blindness - known as a scotoma - is in 
    the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up 
    to the entire hemifield. <br />
    <br />
    Although individuals with damage to V1 are not consciously aware of stimuli 
    presented in their blind field, Larry Weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 
    1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field, 
    some observers do better than chance. This ability to detect stimuli that the observer 
    is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus (for example, 
    whether an 'X' or 'O' has been presented in the blind field). This general phenomenon 
    has been dubbed “blindsight.” <br />
    <br />
    It is unsurprising from a neurological viewpoint that damage to V1 leads to 
    reports of blindness. Visual processing occurs in the brain in a hierarchical series of 
    stages (with much crosstalk and feedback between areas). As V1 is the first cortical 
    area in this hierarchy any damage to V1 severely limits visual information passing 
    from retina, via the LGN and then V1, to higher cortical areas. However, the route from 
    retina through V1 is not the only visual pathway into cortex (though it is by far the 
    largest); it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting 
    blindsight is due to preserved pathways into extrastriate cortex that bypass V1. What 
    is surprising is that activity in these extrastriate areas is apparently insufficient to 
    support visual awareness in the absence of V1. <br />

    <br />
    Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), is a deadly 
    condition that is caused by acute exposure to high altitudes. It commonly occurs 
    above 2,500m (8,000 ft). Headache is a primary symptom used to diagnose altitude 
    sickness. A headache occurring at an altitude above 8000 ft combined with any of the 
    following symptoms indicates probable altitude sickness: <br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting </li>
    <li>Fatigue or weakness </li>
    <li>Dizziness or light-headedness </li>
    <li>Insomnia </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p align="center"><br />
    The most serious symptoms of altitude sickness are due to edema (fluid accumulation 
    in the tissues of the body). At a very high altitude humans can get either high altitude 
    pulmonary edema (HAPE), or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). These syndromes 
    are potentially fatal. <br />
    <br />
    Altitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at 
    higher elevations, in order to avoid altitude sickness. Once above approximately 
    10,000 ft, most climbers and high altitude trekkers follow the “golden rule” – climb 
    high, sleep low. For high altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regime might be to 
    stay a few days at a base camp, climb up to a higher camp (slowly), then return to 
    base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp would then include an overnight 
    stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at 
    higher altitudes to let the body &quot;get used&quot; to the oxygen level there, a process that 
    involves the production of additional red blood cells. <br />
    <br />
    The weather <br />
    <br />
    Temperature in Tibet varies with the seasons. May to mid-October is pleasant along 
    much of the trekking routes. However, going over 5000+ meters (6,500 ft) can be very 
    cold with high winds.  On Lhakpa Ri from May to September, one can expect 
    maximum temperatures between 15-25°C (59 to 77°F) at 3500- 4000 meters (11,483– 
    13,123ft) and 5-10°C (41 to 50°F) minimum. Once above 5500 meters ((18,044 ft), the 
    temperature drops to between -10 and - 15 °C (14 to 5°F) and at 6500 meters (21,325 
    ft) it can be anywhere between – 20 and -25 °C (-4 to -13°F). It is always difficult to 
    predict or assume weather conditions at higher altitudes because when the day gets 
    gloomy, the temperature plummets almost too fast to record. </p>

  <h2 align="center">THE CLIMBING TEAM </h2>
  <p align="center"> SABRIYE TENBERKEN <br />
    <br />
    “A lot of people say I can’t do it because I’m blind, or I have red hair, or my feet are too 
    big. Get the right team around you, don’t set boundaries and go for it.” <br />
    - Sabriye Tenberken <br />
    <br />
    Blind since the age of 12, Sabriye was raised with the belief that blindness was more a 
    personality trait than a disability.  The result is a woman who has transformed attitudes 
    about the blind in some of the most far-reaching places on the planet. <br />
    <br />
    Sabriye decided to study Tibetology at Bonn University after a curator allowed her to 
    touch Tibetan artifacts in a travelling exhibition.  After enrolling, she soon discovered 
    there was no Braille text for the Tibetan language, so she created one herself in order 
    to continue her studies. <br />
    <br />
    Determined to share the Braille text with the people of Tibet, she was initially met with 
    hesitation from the Chinese authorities because of her blindness and the difficulties 
    they thought she would experience in Tibet. Most Tibetans believe that blind people 
    are possessed by demons or have done something horribly wrong in their past life. <br />
    <br />
    Sabriye persevered, travelling to Lhasa in 1997. She found a local Tibetan woman to 
    accompany her on horseback through the frozen Himalayas to find blind kids to attend 
    a school she was setting up for them.  She found children who had been shunned by 
    their parents, spurned by their villages, hidden away and tied to beds in dark rooms for 
    years, some of them had never been taught to walk. <br />
    <br />
    During these travels, Sabriye met Paul Kronenberg, her partner both personally and 
    professionally, with whom she established the first school for the blind in Tibet and 
    their organization Braille Without Borders. <br />
    <br />
    Their groundbreaking work has been recognized internationally as a model for schools 
    for the visually impaired in developing countries. The children are taught how to read, 
    write and speak in three languages; Tibetan, Chinese and English and are given the 
    tools needed for blind people to live independently in a sighted world.  After 9 years, 
    the first of her students are graduating, establishing businesses and becoming the 
    principal breadwinners for their families. <br />
    <br />
    Governments around the world have invited them to establish their trademark program 
    in their own countries.  They are establishing a new project in Kerala, India where they 
    are training both sighted and blind people to fulfil that need. <br />
    <br />
    Sabriye’s work has won worldwide recognition including Time Magazine's 2004 
    “Hero of the Year Awards” in both Europe and Asia. In 2005, she was nominated for 
    the Nobel Peace Prize, named Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum, 
    cited as Oprah’s personal choice on her show “Eight Women Oprah Wants You To 
    Know,” and in August of 2006 was awarded two Mother Teresa Awards, one for 
    herself, the other for Braille Without Borders.  This is the only time the same person 
    has been recognized twice in the same year. <br />

    ERIK WEIHENMAYER <br />
    <br />
    “I wasn’t afraid to go blind and see darkness. I was afraid to be swept to the sidelines 
    and be forgotten, to be obsolete.” <br />
    - Blind climber Erik Weihenmayer <br />
    <br />
    On May 25, 2001, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind man in history to reach the 
    summit of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. And on September 5, 2002, when 
    he stood on top of Mt. Kosciusko in Australia, Weihenmayer completed his 7-year 
    quest to climb the Seven Summits - the highest mountains on each of the 
    seven continents, joining only 150 mountaineers ever to do so, all of them sighted. <br />
    <br />
    Shortly after losing his sight at the age of twelve, Erik lost his mother in a tragic car 
    accident. In an effort to strengthen the family during this difficult time, Erik’s father, an 
    ex-Marine, took his three teenage sons on climbing trips to the far reaches of the 
    globe including South America, India and Nepal. While awkward at first, Erik 
    persevered and has emerged today as one of the most exciting and respected 
    athletes in the world. In addition to climbing, Erik is also an acrobatic skydiver, long 
    distance cyclist, snow skier, para-glider and marathon runner. <br />
    <br />
    Erik's extraordinary accomplishments have gained him abundant press coverage 
    including repeated visits to The Today Show and NBC Nightly News, The Oprah 
    Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, and The Tonight Show. He has also been 
    featured on the cover of Time magazine and in Sports Illustrated, People, and 
    Men's Journal. <br />
    <br />
    Erik has won a wide variety of prestigious awards and has been responsible for raising 
    millions of dollars for blind organizations and other worthy causes in the United States 
    and around the world. In a recent poll, Erik was named as one of the 20 most 
    inspirational people in America.</p>

    international translator. This would make her the first blind university student ever from 
    Tibet. <br />
    <br />
    GYENSHEN ‘Victory’ <br />
    <br />
    Gyenshen, 17 years old, had been selected for a scholarship to attend a good school 
    in Beijing when he became blind at age 9. He was hidden in his home for four years, 
    when he was found and brought into the school in Lhasa. He also now attends the 
    same sighted school as Sonam Bhumtso and is considered by his teachers to be the 
    smartest in the class. <br />
    <br />

    establish another blind training center in Tibet. His mission is to rescue blind kids 
    unable to escape horrible situations like the one he suffered. <br />
    <br />
    DACHUNG ‘Little Moon’ <br />
    <br />
    Dachung, 14 years old, joined the school in 2001. He has learned to speak and write 
    in Chinese and Tibetan. Dachung says “When I climb I can show that blind people can 
    do the same as sighted people can do. I am also sure that I can climb a mountain very 
    well. I have no fear. <br />
    <br />
    FOLLOWING THE FILM: Dachung's father died. Dachung is now studying vocational 
    skills at the Braille Without Borders farm, which is close to his home village, allowing

  <h2 align="center">BLINDSIGHT Log Line </h2>
  <p align="center"> BLINDSIGHT follows the gripping adventure of six Tibetan teenagers who set out to 
    climb the 23,000 foot Lhakpa Ri on the north side of Mount Everest. A dangerous 
    journey soon becomes a seemingly impossible challenge made all the more 
    remarkable by the fact that the teenagers are blind. <br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p align="center"> BLINDSIGHT Long Synopsis <br />
    <br />
    Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Tibetan Himalayas, BLINDSIGHT is a 
    gripping feature documentary, about six blind Tibetan teenagers whose lives are about 
    to change. They have been rejected by a culture that considers them to be possessed 
    by demons and have overcome enormous odds, helped hugely by attending a special 
    school for the blind in Lhasa, set up by the inspirational blind teacher Sabriye 
    Tenberken. <br />
    <br />
    Erik Weihenmayer makes his imprint on the world through extraordinary physical 
    accomplishments. Sabriye Tenberken takes the intellectual approach through 
    education. Both of them have spent their adult lives achieving what most people would 
    think impossible. Erik and Sabriye both went blind at the age of 12, he in America, she 
    in Germany. Until 2004, they had never met. <br />
    <br />
    Erik is a legend in the world of mountaineering. He is the only blind man ever to have 
    scaled Mount Everest. He has also climbed the world’s seven greatest peaks, a feat 
    approximately 150 other mountaineers have achieved, all of them sighted. <br />
    <br />
    Sabriye is known worldwide for changing the face of blindness in Tibet, a region where 
    many believe blind people are paying for evils committed in a past life. Initially the 
    Chinese were hesitant to allow her access to Tibet because of her blindness, but 
    Sabriye persevered and made her way on horseback into the frozen Himalayas 
    searching for blind children in remote villages to attend a school she was setting up in 
    Lhasa. <br />
    <br />
    Erik’s summit of Mount Everest captured the imagination of Sabriye and her students. 
    Determined to find out how he did it, Sabriye wrote to Erik explaining the hardships 
    her kids had endured and their fascination with him. She invited him to visit and Erik 
    accepted. But rather than just speak to the school, Erik brought his world-class 
    Everest climbing team to Tibet so six chosen students could learn how to climb blind 
    like him. <br />
    <br />
    One of them is Tashi. His father sold him to a Chinese couple who took him to Lhasa 
    and threw him on the streets to beg when he was 10 years old. After years of silence 
    about his past, Tashi decided to find his family. We follow him in the search for his 
    home to a remote region of southern China and watch first-hand as he confronts the 
    father who abandoned him nine years before. BLINDSIGHT grips you with the 
    suspense of whether Tashi’s deep scars will prevent him or propel him to his goal of 
    making the summit with his hero Erik. <br />
    <br />
    BLINDSIGHT chronicles the extraordinary adventure of a death-defying three week 
    expedition up Lhakpa Ri, a dramatic 23,000 foot peak which rises symbolically and 
    spectacularly beside Mount Everest. <br />
    <br />
    BLINDSIGHT weaves the compelling life stories of students Kyila, Sonam Bhumtso, 
    Tashi, Gyenshen, Dachung and Tenzin with this intense mountain drama into a 
    riveting tapestry. <br />
