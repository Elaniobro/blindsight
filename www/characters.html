                      <br />
                    </h2>
                    <h3><i>&ldquo;When someone describes a beautiful scene to me I can translate that into a sense of beauty. What I like is that somebody took the time to describe what&rsquo;s moved them, and I feel a great connection to that person then.&rdquo;</i>  &mdash; Erik<br />
                      <br />
                      On May 25, 2001, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind man in history to reach the summit of Mount Everest, the world&rsquo;s highest peak. And on September 5, 2002, when he stood on top of Mt. Kosciusko in Australia, Weihenmayer completed his 7-year quest to climb the Seven Summits &mdash; the highest mountains on each of the seven continents, joining only 150 mountaineers ever to do so, all of them sighted. </h3>
                    <p>Shortly after losing his sight at the age of twelve, Erik lost his mother in a tragic car accident. In an effort to strengthen the family during this difficult time, Erik&rsquo;s father, an ex&ndash;Marine, took his three teenage sons on climbing trips to the far reaches of the globe including South America, India and Nepal. While awkward at first, Erik persevered and has emerged today as one of the most exciting and respected athletes in the world. In addition to climbing, Erik is also an acrobatic skydiver, long distance cyclist, snow skier, para&ndash;glider and marathon runner</p>
                    <p>Erik&rsquo;s extraordinary accomplishments have gained him abundant press coverage including repeated visits to NBC&rsquo;s Today Show and Nightly News, Oprah, Good Morning America, and the Tonight Show. He has also been featured on the cover of Time magazine and in Sports Illustrated, People, and Men&rsquo;s Journal. </p>
                    <p>Erik has won a wide variety of prestigious awards and has been responsible for raising millions of dollars for blind organizations and other worthy causes in the United States and around the world. In a recent poll, Erik was named as one of the 20 most inspirational people in America.</p>

                      &ldquo;A lot of people say I can&rsquo;t do it because I&rsquo;m blind, or I have red hair, or my feet are too big. Get the right team around you, don&rsquo;t set boundaries and go for it.&rdquo;</i>  &mdash; Sabriye</h3>
                    <p>Blind since the age of 12, Sabriye was raised with the belief that blindness was more of a personality trait than a disability. The result is a woman who has transformed attitudes about the blind in some of the most remote places on the planet. </p>
                    <p>After creating the Braille text for the Tibetan language, Sabriye was determined to share the Braille text with the people of Tibet, many of whom believe blind people are possessed by demons.  At the age of 26, she traveled on her own to Lhasa where she bought two horses, found a local Tibetan woman to join her and headed out into the frozen Himalayas to find blind kids to attend a school she was setting up for them.</p>
                    <p>She found children who had been shunned by their parents, spurned by their villages, hidden away and tied to beds in dark rooms for years, some of them had never been taught to walk. </p>
                    <p>Today, thanks to the work of Sabriye and her partner Paul Kronenberg and their project Braille Without Borders, the perception of blindness in Tibet is being transformed. </p>
                    <p>During these travels, Sabriye met her partner Paul Kronenberg with whom she established the first school for the blind in Tibet and their organization Braille Without Borders. </p>
                    <p>Their students are taught how to read, write and speak in three languages; Tibetan, Chinese and English and are given the tools needed to live independently.  After 9 years, the first of her students are graduating, establishing businesses and becoming the principal breadwinners for their families. </p>
                    <p>Their groundbreaking work has been recognized internationally as a model for schools for the visually impaired in developing countries. </p>
                    <p>They are establishing a new project in Kerala, India where they are training both sighted and blind people to establish satellite projects for the blind around the world. </p>
                    <p>Sabriye is a Nobel Peace Prize Nominee, Mother Theresa Award recipient and Oprah&rsquo;s personal choice on her show &ldquo;Eight Women Oprah Wants You To Know.&rdquo;</p>
